# In Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated
# throughout a program. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it
# using the assignment operator (=). 

age = 34 # Integer
name = "Deep" # String
cgpa = 8.59 # Float

# Rule of defining a variable in Python
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an unedrscore (_).
# They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g. if, for, while) as variable names.

# 34age = 4 # Invalid because variable cannot start with a number
age = 32    # Valid because variable can start with a number
# a$$ge = 45 # Invalid because variables cannot contain special characrers other _ 
__age = 34
__nice_45 = 34
a_b_c_7 = "Sam"
